Root Level:

* `your-dns-blocker/`: This is your project root directory.
* `go.mod`: Defines the module path and dependencies.
* `go.sum`: Contains checksums for module dependencies.
* `README.md`: Project description, setup instructions, usage, etc.
* `.env.example`: Example environment variables (e.g., API keys, port numbers).
* `configs/`:
  * `config.yaml` (or `config.json`): Configuration files for both the DNS server and the web management interface (e.g., DNS listening address, upstream DNS servers, Gin/Echo port, blocklist URLs).

`cmd/`:

This directory contains the entry points for your main applications. In your case, you'll likely have one primary executable:

* `cmd/dns-blocker/`:
   * `main.go`: This is the main application entry point. It will:
        * Load configuration.
        * Initialize the DNS server.
        * Initialize the Gin/Echo web server.
        * Start both services concurrently (e.g., using goroutines).
        * Handle graceful shutdown.

`internal/`:

This directory holds private application and library code that you don't want other projects to import. This is a Go convention to enforce encapsulation.

* `internal/dns/`: This is the core of your DNS blocker logic.
  * `server.go`: Contains the main DNS server logic, listening for UDP/TCP DNS requests on port 53, handling incoming queries, and forwarding/resolving them. This will heavily use libraries like `github.com/miekg/dns`.
  * `resolver.go`: Manages upstream DNS server communication (e.g., forwarding queries to Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS).
  * `filter.go`: Implements the actual blocking logic. It checks if a queried domain is on a blocklist or whitelist.
  * `lists.go`: Handles loading, updating, and managing your blocklists (e.g., from local files, external URLs).
* `internal/config/`:
   * `config.go`: Defines the Go structs for your application's configuration and includes functions to load and parse `config.yaml`.
* `internal/api/`: This is where your Gin/Echo web API logic resides.
  * `handlers.go`: Contains the HTTP handler functions for your API endpoints (e.g., `GetBlocklist`, `AddDomainToBlocklist`, `GetStats`). These handlers will interact with the `internal/dns` components.
  * `routes.go`: Defines the Gin/Echo routes and associates them with the handlers.
  * `models.go`: Defines the data structures (structs) for your API requests and responses (e.g., `AddDomainRequest`, `StatsResponse`).
* `internal/logging/`:
  * `logger.go`: Sets up and provides a consistent logging interface for your application (e.g., using `log` package or a structured logger like `logrus` or `zap`).

`web/`:

This directory is for your static web assets and templates if you're serving a frontend directly from Go.

* `web/static/`:
  * `js/`: JavaScript files for your frontend dashboard.
  * `css/`: CSS stylesheets.
  * `img/`: Images, favicons, etc.
* `web/templates/`:
  * `index.html`: The main entry point for your web dashboard.
  * `dashboard.html`: Example of a dashboard template.
(Other `.html` files for different pages/components if you're doing server-side rendering).

`scripts/`:

Contains any shell scripts or automation scripts for your project.

* `update_blocklists.sh`: A script to manually trigger blocklist updates (or you might build this into your Go app).
* `build.sh`: A script for building the Go application (e.g., `go build -o bin/dns-blocker cmd/dns-blocker/main.go`).

How the pieces connect:

1. `main.go` starts both the `dns.Server` (listening on port 53) and the `api.Router` (Gin/Echo server, listening on a different port, e.g., 8080).
2. The `dns.Server` handles incoming DNS queries. It uses `dns.Filter` to check against `dns.Lists` and `dns.Resolver` for upstream lookups.
3. The `api.Handlers` (Gin/Echo) expose endpoints that allow users to:
   * Query the current status of the `dns.Server`.
   * Add/remove entries from `dns.Lists`.
   * View `logging.Logger` output (perhaps through a web interface).
4. The `web/` directory contains the HTML, CSS, and JS that provides the user interface, which makes API calls to the `api.Handlers` to manage the DNS blocker.
5. `configs/config.yaml` centralizes all configurable parameters for both the DNS and API components, loaded by `internal/config/config.go`.

This structure promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability, which are key for any non-trivial Go application.
